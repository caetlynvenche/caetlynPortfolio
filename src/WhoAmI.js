            <p>I have always adored making things. When I was younger, I focused mainly on crochet and drawing, but as I have gotten older, more of my focus has turned towards the technical side as well. I now make many of the same things as when I was younger, but also have been putting more time and focus into making websites and some games.</p> 
            <p>I am excited to see what I am able to create in the future, and am grateful to be taking the steps into that future now.</p>
